please stay safe, my loves. you're in my heart

what a scary, chaotic day on earth. my heart is with everyone in Paris and Japan

what's mine is yours. all of you. always. *shows up at your classroom door in disguise with a green tea soy latte*

my babies, 
a random but necessary thank you for your love, patience, dedication, support, humor, and kindness. 
you are everything to me.
